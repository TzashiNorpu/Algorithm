### create new file
- If you are already in the Project View, press <b>Alt+Insert (New) </b>| Class. Project View can be activated via Alt+1.

- To create a new class in the same directory as the current one use <b>Ctrl+Alt+Insert (New...)</b>.

- You can also do it from the Navigation Bar, press <b>Alt+Home</b>, then choose package with arrow keys, then press <b>Alt+Insert</b>.

- Another useful shortcut is View | Select In (<b>Alt+F1</b>), Project (1), then <b>Alt+Insert</b> to create a class near the existing one or use arrow keys to navigate through the packages.

- And yet another way is to just type the class name in the existing code where you want to use it, IDEA will highlight it in red as it doesn't exist yet, then press <b>Alt+Enter</b> for the Intention Actions pop-up, choose Create Class.

- Esc always brings the focus back to the editor
